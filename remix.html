    The Multimedia Remix Project was a great experience and a chance to transform writing to visuals in the form of a documentary off of one of my group members, Ryan Watson’s, Cultural Analysis Project.  Since this was a group project, lots of communication and planning went into making this film.  We had to listen to everyones plans, put together what we all thought as a group was a good project and each collaborated on what to put in the film or not.  When we decided to use Ryan’s paper we knew we were going to have to use interviews and facts about social media to get our point across in this documentary and I do think we did a good job representing those ideas.  Composing this made us research more in depth and look at a broader variety of intel instead of just facts of the internet.  This includes opinion based responses from the interviewee.  We chose this specific topic because we thought that we could create a well formulated documentary where we could interview and evaluate the responses from fellow peers.  The most challenging part was making the video under 9 minutes, there was lots of parts we had to cut out of the film even though we wished we could keep them in.  For this particular assignment, college students opinion was the best way to go for this documentary, instead of just listing off a bunch of boring facts that we found on the internet, we went out and used creativity skills to make the best video we could.  In order to make the best documentary we could we had to communicate and collaborate with one another to put all 4 of our ideas into one big one and transform that into our video.  I think we accomplished a lot more than we would have as individuals so I do think that working in a group for projects such as this was helpful and let us create a much better video.  A lot of planning went into this project, we talked a lot in group chats and helped each other out with interviews and ideas for the film.  If we ended up getting to redo this project I don’t think I would elect to change much.  I personally thought that this was a very good film for having a 9 minute cap to it.  I thought the greatest aspect of our film in my opinion was our organization and how we laid everything out in the order we thought was right.  We made our design decisions based on what looked and felt the best to us.  We wanted to make the video visually appealing while getting our facts and opinions out on the social media topic at hand.  We tried to pick a variety of people to interview, making sure we had at least one of each sex to voice their opinion.  This was overall a very fun and entertaining project for me.  It challenged me in more ways than just writing a paper.  It made me use more creativity and helped me on my communication skills when dealing with creating and editing the video with my team.  Everyone did their part and thats why I think we ended with such a good final video.  Only some parts needed to be fixed, small bugs, but for the amount of time we had and with no prior knowledge of creating videos I think we did a really good job.
