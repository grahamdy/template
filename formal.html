    Mechanical engineering is a rigorous field that requires hours of work including researching and communicating.  You can not make it in the field of engineering without staying updated on technology, researching and communicating with other engineers.  It is important to analyze others work and brainstorm ideas that can help you on your project or for your job.  Mechanical Engineering is defined as a field that uses engineering, physics and material science to analyze, design and innovate mechanical systems.  Which include new forms of technology, cars, trains, and almost everything with an engine, a mechanical engineer had some part of that.  Communication and research are key, a lot of the time engineers will be working on projects with others, which in that case would need to be able to communicate and explain their thoughts and ideas.  You will have to write and present large amounts of research that will back up your ideas and help you move forward.  Even the tasks that are individual will require extensive research and perhaps communication with other engineers to discuss and get opinions on your idea.  The field of mechanical engineering is ever growing and if you stop for one second you could be left behind. Discipline is extremely important and you need to work harder and harder to be able keep up and stay on top!  Building knowledge is a huge part of engineering and in any field of study.  You need to always be on top and know your subject, if you’re working on a new design for a part of a car you need to research that car, the history of that car, possible ways to create that part and a way to construct that part.  Also you need to know if the technology that is needed to create the part has been invented yet by communicating with other engineers and people who have dealt with it before.  It is an ever growing field and research and communication are the keys to innovation.

Analyzing scholarly articles is an important part to research.  You need to dissect each paragraph in order to grasp the information that is in each section.  In an article written by the ASHRAE it talks about how mechanical engineering is the number one discipline in engineering.  “Despite its popularity with males, mechanical engineering has the lowest percentage of women (13.1%) of all disciplines .” this being true it makes it seem like its mainly a manly major, which to women can be discouraging.  To some encouraging and they see it as a challenge to prove that they deserve a shot at it as well.  Engineering is a growing field and for the last five years has increased by 13%.  Engineering in general is still growing and mechanical is its most competitive field.  

    When reading magazines and other trade publications you can learn a lot in the field of study that you’re in.  For example, in U.S. News & World Report on article by Thomas K. Grose he describes mechanical engineering as a cutting-edge field and as number one in the job market.  He writes about several students who are either recent graduates or students at universities with their majors being mechanical engineering.  They talk about how important of a field they think it is and how they feel like many of the worlds problems can be solved by mechanical engineering.  Such as the fossil fuels emissions.  Finding more efficient to produce energy is critical to the world and is in the field of mechanical engineering.  “Mechanical engineering is all about designing, building, and maintaining machines of all types and sizes. It's an engineering classic, dating to the early days of the industrial revolution, when engineering know-how was needed to harness the potential of the steam engine. But despite its 19th-century pedigree, M.E. is today at the heart of many cutting-edge technologies.” -Thomas Grose.  He talks about how in almost every new innovation or technology a mechanical engineer plays a part in making that happen.  Mechanical engineers have to master several skills such as calculus and have to know parts of chemical, electrical and environmental engineering which according to Larry Silverberg, the associate head of the mechanical and aerospace engineering program at North Carolina State University is a huge selling point to chose as a major.   Many mechanical engineers are getting hired straight out of college to work as engineers for big companies because it is such an attractive field, especially if you go to graduate school.

    Communication is critical in the field of engineering.  So much depends on your ability to be able to communicate and present information.  Group projects will require lots of communication and cooperation in order to meet the goal.  You need to be able to communicate in your writing as well.  Many bosses or peers will ask for a something such as a progress report which will require you to type up your work and present it in a written form that's easy to understand.  When collaborating with other engineers, you need to be able to present your opinions and ideas in an effective manner which people can understand.  Jared Lewis has this to say on the topic of being able to communicate with others on projects or in conferences.  “This requires the ability to employ active listening, or knowing what questions to ask to elicit a response and synthesize the information in such a way that they can create better and more effective designs.”  It is important to understand what others are saying so that you can do your part when working in a group better as well. It is very important to present the information in a way that someone who does not have mechanical engineering background that you have, could understand and comprehend.  As a mechanical engineer you will need to be able to communicate using technology such as emails, video calls and any other form of electronic communication.  Since you’re going to be communicating in these forms you will have to use proper grammar, punctuation and need a good understanding of the english language.  Another big part of communicating as an engineer is having good people skills.  If people like you and can get along with you it is often times easier to convey information with one another.  Communication will always be a vital skill to have as a mechanical engineer.  It goes hand in hand with research and technology.  As technology updates so do the ways to communicate and when researching you may have to communicate with others to get their reports to research methods they used in order to design what you are working on.  There are a few ways to communicate with people when presenting.  Verbal, speaking plainly, vocals such as volume and rhythm and body language, facial expressions and posture.  A study done at North Carolina University (TIBBS) stated that body movements are 55% of the presentation. It is important to always make eye contact and posture when making a presentation to keep your audience focused and paying attention. Getting in sync with your listener is important too.  Mary Bennet had this to say on the matter.  “We naturally match others’ body language and voice in order to get in sync with the person with whom we are communicating. Being aware of these can help you increase the effectiveness of your communication.”  You have to know your audience and be able to effectively have a conversation.  When preparing to give a presentation, practice is key.  Make sure you can deliver the important information without spending too much time on a subject.  Always stay positive and never say anything negative.  Mastering communication skills is a huge part of being a mechanical engineer.

    In an interview with Jim Lowe a retired Ford mechanical engineer I asked about how he felt about the importance of communication, research and technology in the work field.  He had this to say about communication.  “You are constantly communicating everyday whether you want to or not.  When on projects I would have a meeting every day where people gave a report on their statuses.  My boss came around about 3 times a week to check up.”  This was a great opportunity to get first hand knowledge from someone who worked in the field of mechanical engineering for over 30 years.  He couldn’t stress enough the importance of communication.  When on the topic of research he said that he would do a lot of research when ever starting a new design.  He would have nights and nights dedicating to looking up information, gathering data and collecting it in one place to use it for his designs.  He often had to research the technology he wanted to use to make sure 1. it existed and 2. it was available for his use.  He was a fantastic mechanical engineer and I was very happy I had a chance to talk to him.  He is a great role model hand helped a lot with first hand experience with communication, research and technology.  He also mentioned how hard you need to work.  He said “Sometimes when you think you’re close to being done you might hit a wall, and you have to keep digging until you can get passed that wall.”  

    Technology is and ever growing thing.  Everyday new inventions are coming out and some took mechanical engineers to figure out.  Using technology as an engineer is extremely important.  You need to use technology for almost every design or project that you are working on.  Not only are you using technology to communicate and to research but you are also working to create new technology such as a more fuel efficient engine.  Technology is everything in the engineering world, new software, new hardware, new tools, new toys to use and new designs and of course thousands of new possibilities.  As a mechanical engineer you are going to rely on technology everyday in order to get your job done.  Researching is a vital part to engineering and cannot be done unless you have the the technology necessary to get that information that is needed for your design/work.  As a mechanical engineer you will have to know your way around a computer.  CAD is short for Computer Aided Drafting which is used to design things on the computer before bringing them to life.  It takes a good amount of skill and it is necessary to know how it works if you have to use it for your field.  When technology changes so does the field of engineering, quickly mastering this new helpful technology and using it to help with their personal jobs.  In “Engineering Evolving” an article written by Joseph Coates he states “Engineering has brought us highly effective and economically productive energy sources: first water, then coal, later petroleum, and now natural gas and, to a significant degree, nuclear power. In the future, there will be less dependency on single sources and greater dependency on multiple sources. The one greatest uncertainty in the energy future is whether greenhouse warming will prove to be real and significant. Should it be both, engineering will be called on initially and in the long run to deal with the goal of massive energy conservation.”  Engineers are the first called on when a new technology comes out.  They let us jump on it and immediately start working to use it for mechanical engineering needs.  That is why technology is so important to the future of mechanical engineering.  It opens up new jobs and helps us create a better world.
    Researching is a task is done daily by mechanical engineers.  You will be required to do hours and hours of research while getting your education.  The research skills that you learn while in school will transfer into later times in your career as an engineer where you will have to call upon the skills to help you accomplish your task or goal.  Researching is extremely important in order to be successful as a mechanical engineer.  It can often be a difficult and long process and will require you to do actual digging in books.  Although now a days most research is integrated with technology.  Without doing research there can be several consequences if your thoughts/designs without back up fail, including losing your job or even to the point of a lawsuit.  Prince Samuels on the importance of research.  “Most people make decisions without gathered informations to back them up.  Only few do.  The problem is most people aren't patient enough to put in the effort.  Research requires time, effort, and sometimes money to have the evidence you need to make a sound decision that's why many avoid it.”  This couldn’t be more true, think about how many times you or someone else has said something that you couldn’t back up.  You may think you know something but that is when you need to research to make sure that you are correct.  Proper and correct research can save time and money for you and/or your company.  
    Thus in conclusion mechanical engineering is a very difficult field to be successful in unless you are ready to work.  The field of engineering is a popular and is growing.  Employment is growing but it still takes lots of work and dedication in order to be successful.  This field requires tons of communication.  You will be asked to present.  You will be asked to type or email written reports that contain the status of your project.  When interviews Jim he stressed the importance of communication in the field.  He told me several times that to be an engineer it is not possible to just keep to yourself.  It requires you to have face to face interactions on a daily basis along with lots of group activities and projects that are shared.  Being a mechanical engineer requires you to be good with computers and to updated always on technology as you will be needing technology for most of you designs or projects.  Technology is always updating and you need to stay on top with it.  Getting behind can have severe consequences.  As a mechanical engineer you will be required to learn new technology constantly and at a quick speed.  Research and discipline are extremely important as well.  You cannot go on with just a hunch, you need to dig for the information and be able to back up what you are doing.  Not researching something could result in an accident and totally ruin your design.  You need the facts and the technology for everything you want to design or use.  In order to save time and money research will be used on a common basis.  Using all three of these will prove to make your job as a mechanical engineer a lot easier.  Mechanical engineering is a fantastic  major and a great job.  Yes, it takes work but if its right for you, you will be able to do it.
