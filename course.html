    I was never a bad writer as I grew up but my writing style never really changed before this class.  This class challenged me in many ways to transform writing to not just a 5 paragraph essay but into a movie (Multimedia Remix Project) or a movement of sorts about an issue important to me (Cultural Analysis Project).  I’ve had to revisit old memories which have shaped me into the person I am today and express them through writing.  As an engineer major, writing is definitely not the most important subject so I never really focused all my energy on it.  There were several different aspects of writing I wasn’t very good at.  Editing was one of them.  I didn’t like to write a 2000-3000 word paper and then go back through it and check every sentence for a typo or grammatical error.  No I did not like editing my papers at all.  This class however required me to do so.  I never challenged myself in writing in high school, rather I enjoyed the mathematics and sciences part better.  With this class there was no way i would pass with turning my rough draft in as my final.  I was going to have to work very hard at fixing every mistake and making the best papers I physically could.  This was certainly no high school class.  I had to adjust schedules around to make time to write these essays that I thought would be a cakewalk.  However difficult they were, they were also enjoyable to write.  I liked most of the subjects I was required to write about and was happy with almost every single thing I wrote.  
    There were several main projects this semester filled in between with blogs and other types of projects.  The first of which was a project based on what piece of technology shaped you into picking the major you are currently in.  For this project I told how lego’s and wood shop pushed me towards mechanical engineering.  The second project was a project based on a social issue you took a stance on.  This was called the Cultural analysis project.  I used Robin Thicke’s Blurred Lines music video as an example of sexism and how it itemized women.  The third project, Formal Research paper I researched mechanical engineering and told the importance of about 3 main topics, research, communication and technology in mechanical engineering.  The 4th project was the Multimedia Remix project where my group and I used one of ours cultural analysis papers to construct a documentary on social medias.  The final project, was this one where I am telling you what I have learned throughout this course and my reflections on this class.  This is called the Course Retrospective Project.
    Something I was really bad at doing in previous essays was filling the word count requirement.  I hated long essays because I felt like I would have to ramble on about certain things and add a lot of fluff just to meet the requirement.  To ensure I didn’t do that in this course I spent a lot of my time before the paper planning it out and scoping up back up ideas that still had some relevance incase I ran out of things to write about the ideas that were making up the paper.  I was almost always able to be able to write even more than the required amount of words and sometimes would to make the essay as good as I thought it could be.  The most difficult paper for me to write throughout the WRA 110 course was probably the Formal Research Paper, which required me to go in depth about the importance of communication, research and technology in my given major, which happened to be mechanical engineering.  The key to success in this paper was researching enough topics so that I wouldn’t run out of things to write about.  I had to go deep into research about all three subjects (communication, research and technology) and find out why they were essential to the world of mechanical engineering.  Writing 3000 words about this was not the most fun thing in the world.  In order to do it I needed to be prepared for the essay first and not just jump right in.  Preparation consisted of many different strategies such as ‘spider’ webs and lists of ideas and possible paragraph topics.  To me the key to getting the word count just right was to do the appropriate amount of preparation before actually starting the essay.  The essays were then a piece of cake to write with such a hefty area to pull ideas out of.  
    All throughout high school I was only required to write one research paper so the importance of research was never really apparent to me.  In college and in this class you can not succeed without it.  For every single paper that I wrote in this class I had my fair share of research that went along with it.  With every topic the type of research I had to do changed.  When doing the first paper (Lived Experiences Project) the research I had to do was more personal.  Talking to my mom, looking back for old photos and old memories.  The research for the next paper (Cultural Analysis Project) was totally different.  Since this paper consisted of presenting a social issue and show how it is influenced by a piece of media.  The research conducted in this one was finding a social issue you cared about, finding media that goes against your belief and dissecting that piece of media and finding out facts about that social issue then presenting it in a written essay.  For the Formal Research Paper the research done was in a much more traditional manor.  Looking up articles, finding sections in books and looking up reports on the topics of communication, technology and research about mechanical engineering and then writing it up in a report as if someone was trying to research that.  Research is key part in every single paper that is written and it is one of my skills that I feel has improved in this class.    
    Arrangement of the essay as well as revision are two very important parts.  When you finish the paper and get ready to revise the first thing you want to do is look how it is arranged or how it flows.  You want an essay to have an easy flow from beginning to end and if it just jumps paragraphs few people will be able to understand it and it won't be a very good essay.  A good essay with bad arrangement can end up looking worse than a slightly worse essay with good arrangement.  You cannot have success in writing until you get the arrangement down and right.  Revising an essay can turn a bad essay into a great one.  Fixing every little detail is completely necessary in every essay.  1 little mistake can make the difference in getting a A, even a job or scholarship.  My revising skills prior to this class were not very good.  I would lazily check over papers and usually change very little.  It was not until this class when I noticed on my first paper (Lived Experiences Project) that I would have received a more appealing grade if I took the time to go back and fix all the mistakes in the paper instead of leaving it as is.  The more recent papers I have written for this class I have spent almost just as much time revising the essay as I did writing it.  The more recent essays also have a lot better flow and organization and therefore are better than previous essays I just threw together.  Hands down my revision and arrangement skills have improved because of this class challenging me to become a better writer, researcher and thinker.  It has also let me be more creative in methods that I have used to write.
    The key components that I have improved on this semester as a writer and student in WRA 110 are preparation, revision skills, arrangement, researching and staying on topic.  These are all skills that I did not have going into this class and yes it would of helped if I had known them beforehand but it is a great class to learn them in.  This is a class where I had to learn the skills in order to be successful in the course.  I do believe that this is a great class to prepare me for future writing topics because it taught me a variety of different ways to write papers.  This class boosted my creativity skills and allowed me to be able to even change writing into a documentary.  The Multimedia Remix Project gives you a fantastic chance to get a look at taking writing and transforming it into a documentary.  That was by far my favorite experience of the semester.  An all around great class and a great learning atmosphere.  I enjoyed learning to create my own website, blog and code.  It was a writing class that expanded on writing completely despite only meeting once a week.  I have accomplished any and all goals I had this semester of becoming a better writer.
