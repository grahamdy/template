I am excited to get started and to start this class.  I am a first year student at MSU and have a major of mechanical engineering.  I think this class will benefit me by preparing me as a writer and researcher for engineering.  I am looking forward to getting to know my classmates and working with them on projects if this class includes that.  I have never blogged or managed my own website so I think I am going to enjoy this new experience.\r\n</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tWeek 2:    I have just started CodeAcademy!  It is similar to some computer science classes I have taken in high school so I think it shouldn’t be too difficult for me to learn most of it.  I hope that codeacademy will give me the chance to create a cool website for myself and will help with future encounters in websites and coding.\r\n\r\n</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Week 3:    Today in class we watched a guy talking about gays and the struggles they go through in society.  The guy talked about how his uncle was gay and ended up committing suicide.  This was a very moving presentation to watch and it really brought out a lot emotions in me.  I have the video saved and showed it to my sister who had friends struggle with stuff like this and she found it to be very inspirational and said her friends really liked it!\r\n</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Week 4:    The Social Network was a fantastic movie about Mark Zuckerburg (The creator of Facebook).  It basically talked about the story behind it and all the lawsuits he ended up having to pay for supposedly stealing the idea of Facebook even though it would never of happened without his genius.  He was a revolutionary coding genius who basically wrote facebook in one night.  He is a terrific example of a captain of industry and a great role model to aspiring computer scientists.\r\n</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Week 5:    Chuck is by far my favorite tv show.  Growing up as a kid my dad and I would watch Chuck every monday night together.  I saw every episode aired and television and I have most if not all seasons on DVD.  The reason it is so good is because it is the perfect combination or comedy, action and romance.  The show features a nerd who downloads a supercomputer into his brain and now whenever he sees a government secret he flashes, instantly knowing everything that was in the CIAs database.  He quickly becomes a CIA asset and as the show goes on slowly becomes a spy!  This show is so entertaining and I could watch hours and hours of it.\r\n</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Week 6:    My favorite band of all time has to be Fall Out Boy.  Their music is really soothing and relaxing and also exciting at the same time.  I would probably classify them as alternative rock.  They recently released a new CD, Save Rock & Roll.  It is probably my favorite album by them.  I really enjoy listening to their music while I’m driving and working out.\r\n</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Week 7:    Social media is very addicting.  Sadly I probably spend about 1-2 hours every day on social medias such as twitter and instagram.  Its usually the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning and the last thing I do before I go to bed.  I think I would be much more productive if I didn’t spend any time at all on social medias but they’re entertaining and a good time killer.  Until it becomes too much and you start missing out on stuff.  If social media didn’t exist there would be much more face to face communication and I think it would be better for everyone to meet face to face instead of being friends on a computer.\r\n\r\n</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Week 8:    I am big into Fantasy Football.  9 of my friends and I are in a league together where we get very competitive.  For those who don’t know what Fantasy Football is, look it up and join the online sensation that is about to land me $180 dollars.  That’s right.  If I end up winning my league I will get $180 dollars from everyone’s buy ins added up.  Everyone of my Sundays consists of watching all the games and monitoring my players to see if I am going to win or not.  This year I like my chances of getting to the finals!\r\n</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Week 9:    I am really looking forward to Thanksgiving break.  I love being able to spend time with my family and get some good home cooked food to eat.  The best part is that I will be able to bring back left-overs with me!!  My favorite food isn’t actually turkey it is actually the small about of ham that my grandma brings every thanksgiving.  I could eat plates on plates of that.  Even though its a short break I think it will be good to get a break from school and shift my focus to finals.\r\n</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tWeek 10:    Studying is hard.  I feel like high school was much more homework based rather than having to study a lot.  I like doing busy work over studying but I am slowly adjusting and I think I am becoming a better studier.  I can’t wait to test out my skills on the finals, wait, yes I can.\r\n</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Week 11:    The Eminem chrysler video was awesome.  I am from Ann Arbor so I am a big supporter or Detroit and rebuilding it.  I also think Eminem’s story is sweet and I like his music.  So seeing the support for Detroit had an emotional impact and that’s what I think it is designed to do.  Evoke an emotional response to want you to get a chrysler vehicle.  It is a very good commercial to say the least and I would like to help to Detroit.  But I cannot afford a car of any kind at this time.\r\n</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Week 12:    I miss playing lacrosse a lot.  I was on the lacrosse team all 4 years in high school and a starter on varsity my senior year.  I was all-state and I had the best team ever.  I loved all of those guys like brothers.  The bus rides to and from away games when we won were the most fun.  We would all be singing and throwing in dips and having just a great time.  I miss that connection I do not have here in college.\r\n</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Week 13:    I decided to switch majors this week.  I went from mechanical engineering into business marketing.  I just couldn’t handle the math that was associated with engineering.  Although I liked it I think business is a much better fit for me and I think I am going to make one great business marketer whatever that is.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Week 14:    I had the chance to go to the Michigan Wolverines game when I was home in Ann Arbor but I decided not too. I was a wolverine growing up and hated the spartans.  Call me hypocritical but I love state now and I only bleed green and white.  Sure I will root for michigan when they aren’t playing us but I am so glad to be a spartan and I can’t wait to root for the sports teams here for the next 4 years of my college career.\r\n</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tWeek: 15:    Christmas is my probably my favorite holiday.  I love the snow and putting up decorations and getting to spend it with my family.  I love the relaxing break with my family and my friends.  I love all the christmas shows that are on and pretty much listen to christmas music 24/7.  I can’t wait to get 1 semester of college under my belt and have a great christmas with my family.\r\n</li>\r\n\t\t\t</ol>\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t</main>\r\n\t\t<footer>\r\n\t\t<p>&copy; 2013 Dylan Graham</p>\r\n\t\t</footer>\r\n\t</content>\r\n</body>\t","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
