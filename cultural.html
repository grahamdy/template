Cultural Analysis Project
By: Dylan Graham

















    Women have always been hindered by images showing them as objects in media.  Women work hard to get more respect and when videos show them as just objects or man candy they take a blow.  In Robin Thicke’s Blurred Lines music video women are shown nude, grinding up on the performers.  They are either topless or in very little to no clothes.  The media should not be able portray women in this fashion.  This type of media porn has men thinking that that is how they should treat women.  When young men see videos like this they start to think that women are only objects for their own enjoyment.  People look up to famous artists and try and copy them, but no one should be copying this type of behavior which is disgusting and degrading to women everywhere.  Videos such as these should not be allowed to be public and viewable by everyone and definitely should be unable to use naked women for their film.  Not only are the images shown in the video offensive but also multiple lyrics from the song such as “I know you want it” and “Let me liberate ya”.  Music videos like this should not be legally able to air on such high traffic sites such as YouTube and should not be made in the first place.

    My position on this is that videos such as Robin Thicke’s should not be able to objectify women like they do.  In the music video at one point a woman pulls out a lighter and lights his cigarette like it was what she was supposed to do.  In the video women are shown completely topless walking around in underwear dancing and showing off.  This is completely demoralizing of women and gives guys the image that women are just pieces of meat for us to look at and enjoy which is completely false to what it should be.  Lyrics in this consist of derogatory terms towards women such as “You’re the hottest bitch in this place”. Lyrics such as these put woman down and are inappropriate to be playing on radio stations nationwide where kids are listening every day.  Putting these images in youth could result in them treating and thinking of women as objects and just there for their entertainment.
There are many solutions that can be taken to solve this problem.  Such as censoring the images that are allowed to be released in the media and not allowing music videos to be released where there are situations of men treating women like they belong to them and not showing them any respect.  Women have been fighting for so long to be respected and treated as equals and when stuff like this comes out it makes it harder for people to show them the respect that they deserve.   Objectifying women should not be something that is promoted by famous people that our youth look up to.   Shelli Lantham had this to say on the topic of what Robin Thicke’s Blurred Lines video is promoting. “Girls’ sexuality is so much the focus of our ire. Women who have sex are dirty. Men who have sex are men. Girls who dress to be ogled are hoes. Men who ogle are just doing what comes naturally. This is the kind of reinforced behavior that makes it perfectly acceptable to legislate a woman’s access to birth control and reproductive health care without engaging in balanced conversations about covering Viagra and vasectomies. Our girls cannot win in this environment, not when they are tots in tiaras, not in their teens or when they are coming into adulthood.”  This quote is completely accurate when describing the advancement of women.  So much of these new music videos coming out such Robin Thicke’s Blurred Lines music video are demoralizing and objectifying women making it hard for women to be able to be viewed as equals and it is teaching young men that it is acceptable to treat women in this sort of fashion.  What can we actually do as individuals to fix this problem?  Eric Clapp had this to say on the topic.  “We need to talk to our sons and our brothers about respecting women and respecting themselves.  It starts in homes. It starts in small conversations that treat all people as worthy and equal. It starts with having the courage to speak out against the wide variety of forces in our society that objectify women.”  It starts at the bottom, making sure we talk to the youth about this when videos like these come up and making sure they understand this is not the appropriate way to look at our treat women.
	There have always been men that objectify women and treat them like a piece of meat and there probably always will be but this ideal should not be promoted and certainly not be allowed to be featured in music videos that will be seen millions including young kids in particular men.  This music video in particular is available on YouTube a video website where you can post any video that you want.  Anyone can see this video of a man getting danced on by naked females and promoting the ideals of sexism.  Shown in the video a woman lights his cigarette like it was supposed to be done in “the old days” where sexism existed almost everywhere and woman have fought so hard to be treated as equals and this hinders their ability to move forward.  In the future it would be great to see advancement in this problem so that music videos no matter how demoralizing the lyrics will not be able to have any nudity or objectifying of women in their videos.  This would create positive reinforcement to ensure that the young men growing up would give women the respect that they deserve.  This problem can be easily solved and it’s sickening that it hasn’t already.


Conclusion:  Wrap up all ideas to change and restate the issue and what needs to be done to prevent the young men from thinking this is the way they should behave towards women.


	Robin Thicke’s Blurred Lines music video is just one of many examples of how the music video industry is objectifying women.  It’s a big example however showing many women nude and grinding up on the performers.  Videos such as this should be banned from being able to air and no more videos like this should be able to be produced.  It’s obvious that censorship in music videos needs to increase in order to protect our young men growing up from developing the wrong ideas on how to treat women.  Hopefully in the future we will see some real progress in this situation and everyone can play a role in showing the women in their life that they respect them and do not think they should be trophies or objects.


Executive Summary:  The point of this paper is too express my feelings towards the music video industry, in particular Robin Thickes Blurred Lines music video.  This idea of having women be trophies or looked at as objects is disgusting.  Women deserve the respect that that have always fought for.  When videos like this come out they give the impression that this is the way you should act to be cool or famous and that’s just not true.  This needs to stop.  No more music videos should be able to objectify women in this way.  Using Robin Thickes Blurred Lines video I intend to show how he personally objectifies women and how it works to promote this behavior in the youth.  Behaviors like this cannot be tolerated when releasing music videos that will be seen by millions.  In the future I would like to see no music videos with nudity and no music videos showing women as objects.
