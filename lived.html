		<h1>Lived Experiences Project</h1>
		<p>Lived Experiences – Dylan Graham

	Growing up I was always fascinated by engineering, the way they designed and innovated intrigued me to the point where I decided to choose mechanical engineering as my major.  Many things about engineering interested me, such as designing cars, creating new and better phones/laptops.  Although the thing that really made me love engineering was Legos.  You could create whole entire cities, spaceships, cars and anything you put your mind too.
	The creativity that goes hand in hand with building Legos is inspiring.  Literally anything you put your mind to you could create.  By the time I was 10 years old we had a huge container full of Legos that had probably thousands of pieces in it.  I would go down to the basement, lay out a specific rug that had “grass” and “roads” on it and dump the entire box out.  From that point on I would be building for hours on end.  Leaving a project to eat dinner and running back down after I finished eating to keep working on it.  One of my favorite things to do was to buy a kit that came with directions and try to build it myself without reading the directions.  By the time I could write and draw decently well I was creating my own kits and drawing up directions for people to build the creations that I had designed.  As far as careers going just by building Legos I knew I couldn’t do that for the rest of my life.  First recommended by my father, the career path of engineering where I would build on the skills that I already had as a kid.  He told me that there was no limit to the possibilities I could create if I put my mind to it.  
	Engineering is really a broad major and when I singled it down to mechanical engineering I knew my focus wanted to be in cars and in designing new features for them.  Obviously as I was growing up I wasn’t going to keep just playing with Legos, I used my brainpower to try new things as well.  When I was in middle school I took an auto shop class and absolutely loved it.  I was always in the garage and instead of designing Lego cars and Lego cities I started building small things out of wood.  Creating new things such as wood go carts.  However I never lost my past and would often refer back to things I created using Legos to think of new stuff to try and build.  The Legos really did a good job at opening up my eyes to the possibility of what I could do.  Mechanical engineering is the perfect field for me to go into.  I want to be able to create whatever I want and what I think would be new and innovative. 
	When I got to high school I continued my interests in engineering by taking an engineering class where I designed rockets, solar cars, towers out of marshmallows and toothpicks and other things.  The most memorable thing however was when we had two days to invent the coolest thing you could think off using a wire coat hanger.  At first I thought, what the heck can I make using a dumb coat hanger.  I twisted it until it lay out as a long wire.  That’s when it hit me.  What he was asking us to do was to be creative.  He wanted us to do exactly what an engineer would do.  He wanted to show us the endless possibilities that we could do with this coat hanger.  I immediately thought I should make a toy car or something but obviously a car would take a lot more that a wire coat hanger and it would take a lot more than two days.  The first thing I tried to make was a wire grill to cook on and such.  When it was finished I wasn’t too happy with it so I decided to start over.  This time I put the hook back in the hanger and made a shoe hanger, two wires would stick out to put your shoes on and you could hang it in your closet.  I was happy with this design so I left it.  Then I asked if I could have another hanger to try and create more things.  That time I created a kick stand for a phone so you could set it up while watching videos.  It was really inspiring to think that you could create something so useful and easy just using a coat hanger.  That pushed me closer and closer to choosing engineering as a major.  On our last day of class my teacher came up to me and told me what a pleasure it was to have me in his class and how he felt like I could accomplish great things if I put my mind to it.
	My whole career choice has been building up since I was a kid.  It’s sad to see so many kids nowadays obsessed with call of duty and video games since when I was a kid it was building and thinking of cool stuff to invent instead of just getting fat sitting on the couch.  Molding myself into an engineer could possibly have been the best thing I could have done for myself.  I am confident in my ability to succeed in college and to get a good job when I graduate and I am looking forward to my future as an engineer creating new designs and innovating cars hopefully in the auto industries of America.  With a grandmother and an uncle both working for ford I had the pleasure of seeing how the auto industry was run first hand, It was inspiring to see these high end companies in full swing.  That is the moment I truly knew that I was going to be a mechanical engineer working with cars and motorcycles.  I want to do something that I love for the rest of my life that is why picking the right job field is the most important thing for me.  I truly believe I will have an impact on society and make something that everyone will use maybe for the rest of their lives.  When I think about my past and what led me to become an engineer I think of happy memories.  Memories that I hope to make more of in mechanical engineering.  Legos were one of the most important things to me when I was a kid and as I get older I keep the same ideas in mind when thinking about what I want to create in the future. It would be a lie to say that im not looking forward to my career as a mechanical engineer.
